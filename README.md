# triangular-pentagonal-hexagonal 
Finds numbers which are Triangular, Pentagonal, and Hexagonal.

### Definitions
#### Triangular Numbers
The *n*<sup>th</sup> term of a sequence of triangle numbers is given by `n * (n + 1) / 2`  

So, the first ten triangular numbers are `1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55`

#### Pentagonal Numbers
The *n*<sup>th</sup> term of a sequence of pentagon numbers is given by `n * (3*n - 1) / 2`  

So, the first ten pentagonal numbers are `1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145`

#### Hexagonal Numbers
The *n*<sup>th</sup> term of a sequence of hexagon numbers is given by `n * (2*n - 1)`  

So, the first ten hexagonal numbers are `1, 6, 15, 28, 45, 66, 91, 120, 153, 190`

### Problem Statement
Note that T<sub>285</sub> = P<sub>165</sub> = H<sub>143</sub> = 40755.

Find the next number which is triangular and pentagonal and hexagonal.

### Motivation
This project was completed for [Project Euler - Problem 45](https://projecteuler.net/problem=45).

I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
